# ARTapToPlace
ARTapToPlace

This Unity repository contains an Augmented Reality (AR) project, configured to support AR Foundation and tap-to-place functionality. The provided C# script, ARTapToPlace, enables users to place an AR object in their environment by tapping on a detected surface. This is achieved by raycasting against planes and feature points, and then instantiating the specified AR object at the hit position with a random rotation on the Y-axis. This project is ideal for applications requiring seamless integration of virtual objects into the real world, such as architectural visualization, interactive games, or educational experiences.
